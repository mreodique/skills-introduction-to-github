# This exercises is intended to learn the basic writing and formatting syntax in Github

## Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.
```
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
```

## Styling Text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

 `**`**This is bold text**`**`<br/>
`_`_This text is italicized_`_`<br/>
`~~`~~This is strikethrough~~`~~`<br/>
`**`**This text is `_`_extremely_`_` important**`**`<br/>
`***`***All this text is important***`***`<br/>
This is a `<sub>`<sub>subscript</sub>`</sub>` text<br/>
This is a `<sup>`<sup>superscript</sup>`</sup>` text<br/>
This is an `<ins>`<ins>underlined</ins>`</ins>` text<br/>

## Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

Text that is not a quote
> Text that is a quote

## Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks (`). The text within the backticks will not be formatted.

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Some basic Git commands are:
`````
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
`````

## Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).
